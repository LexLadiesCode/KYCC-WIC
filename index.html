      <h2>Celebration Mission</h2> 
      <p>
          This conference serves as an extension of the Grace Hopper Celebration (GHC) of Women in Computing celebrations. KYCC-WiC is the first community college centered regional conference. Our goal is to continue the primary mission of GHC while reaching out to the community college family. This family is intended to include faculty, students, and businesses that rely on the community colleges to prepare women for today’s technology fields.
      </p>
      <p>
          This conference will be a place where our community can collaborate, network and celebrate the contributions of women in computing.

      <h3>Student Poster Presentations - Open to All Students</h3>
      <p>According to the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT), women comprise only 26% of the technology workforce with number declining since the 1980s.
Women have turned away from the technology and computer industry at a time when it was and is seeing its quickest and most significant growth. </p>

<p>For this poster presentation, create a poster that your college or university could use to recruit women and girls into a computer or information technology major.  Feel free to research the topic in more details and add those components to your poster.</p>

<p>Your presentation should be displayed on a 36" X 48" poster board. Posters must be on display throughout the duration of the conference. Students should announce their intent to participate in the poster presentation by emailing pam.bridgman@kctcs.edu no later than <strong>April 1, 2015</strong>. </p>

<p>Posters will be judged by the originality of the work, applicability to the topic and quality of the presentation. The “Best Poster” winner, first-author, will receive a travel award from ACM-W to the 2015 Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing on October 14-16, 2015 in Houston, Texas. The second and third place poster winners, first author for each, will receive a gift card in the amount of $50. </p>
