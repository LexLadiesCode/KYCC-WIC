Amy is the Director of Marketing at DMD Data Systems.  She received her B.A. in Economics from the Honors College at Michigan State University in 1988. She began her career as a Staff Economist at Laurits R. Christensen Associates (LRCA) in Madison, Wisconsin where she was responsible for the calculation of input productivity for the monthly Total Factor Productivity Index for the United States Postal Service, one of LRCA’s largest clients. After leaving LRCA in conjunction with her spouse's relocation she left the paid workforce, caring for two children and her ailing mother. During that period she was active in volunteer work including serving as Treasurer, Vestry member and Senior Warden for St. Raphael Episcopal Church, as Web Master and Publicity Chair for the University of Kentucky Woman's Club, and various committee positions at her children's schools. Returning to work, Amy was the Finance and Marketing Assistant at DMD Data Systems prior to taking her current position as the Director of Marketing, which she has held since 2012. Amy is currently the Finance Committee chair at her church, is involved with Junior Achievement, and serves on the Bluegrass Community and Technical College Computer and Information Technologies Advisory Board.
